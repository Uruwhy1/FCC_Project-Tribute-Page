                <h3>Faker's Early Life</h3>
                <div class="divider"></div>
            </div>
            <p>Faker was born in Seoul on May 7, 1996.</p>
            <p>Described as an introverted child by his father, Faker exhibited a natural inclination for self-education, often challenging himself with Rubik's cubes and independently learning foreign languages. While he didn't indulge in computer games extensively during his youth, he did find enjoyment in games like Tekken and King of Fighters at a local arcade.</p>
            <p>However, as time passed, he gradually ventured into the realm of PC gaming, exploring titles such as Maplestory and Warcraft III.</p>
            <p>In 2011, when League of Legends made its debut in Korea, Faker was quick to embrace the game and became adept at it in a short span of time. While attending High School, Faker approached his father with a proposition: dropping out of school to pursue a career in esports. His father granted his request a month later.</p>
